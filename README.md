I am given a daily planner to create a schedule.
When i open the planner the current day is displayed and time blocks
are shown with the time of the day. I can enter an event for the time being.
Each time block is color coded to indicate if it's past, present, or future.
On the far right is a save button where my input will be saved and still appear if page get's refreshed.
